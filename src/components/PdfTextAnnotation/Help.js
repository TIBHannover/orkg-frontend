                        A warm welcome at the <strong>ORKG paper annotator</strong>! In this help tour, we will explain the key features of the
                        annotator tool.

                    <p>
                        The goal is to select the <strong>most important sentences</strong> within your paper. Afterwards you can annotate the
                        sentence by selecting the type.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's have a look at some of the features. Click the arrow below.</p>

                        This is the completion bar, indicating your progress while annotating. This bar is there to help you understand when you have
                        sufficiently annotated your paper.

                    <p>
                        The completion is only a suggestion, you can annotate less or more sentences than suggested. So in the end, it is up to you!
